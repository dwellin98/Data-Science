#### What interests me about data science.
What particualr interests me about data science is the exploratory analysis working within the Clinical Research indudstry has opended my eye to how crucial data is within drug development and undertanding the pharamkinetics how to the body metoblises thed drug. It's an industry that is data rich an abudance of data being able to perform anaylsis and udnerstand the effacy fo the drug. An example of this is trying to indentify areas of success. An example of this would be the average temperature of participants was considerably lower than participants how took the placebo, although that may be a very trival example it highlights the level of insight you can asitane from the exploratiry anaylsis.
My intermediate SQL skills have provided me a good introduction to data anaylsis espeically with relational databases which led me on to learning a more pwoerful tool within is
Python programmign liubraires suchas Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib being able to deal with much larger data sets.

### Data Cleaning and Data tidying

Below is  snippet of the processes involved when using Jupyter Notebook to clean and organise data. This is an important step as it creates data that is more understandable,
quicker and easier to run analysis.
