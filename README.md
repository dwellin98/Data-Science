#### What interests me about data science.
What particularly interests me about data science is the exploratory analysis working within the Clinical Research industry has opened my eye to how crucial data is within drug development and understanding the pharmacokinetics and how  the body metabolises the drug. It's an industry that is data rich with an abundance of data being able to perform analysis and understand the efficacy of the drug. An example of this is trying to identify areas of success. An example of this would be the average temperature of participants was considerably lower than participants who took the placebo, although that may be a very trivial example it highlights the level of insight you can asitane from exploratory analysis.
My intermediate SQL skills have provided me a good introduction to data analysis especially with relational databases which led me on to learning a more powerful tool within is
Python programming libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib being able to deal with much larger data sets.

### Data Cleaning and Data tidying

Below is a snippet of the processes involved when using Jupyter Notebook to clean and organise data. This is an important step as it creates data that is more understandable,
quicker and easier to run analysis.

- Identifying the inconsistencies within the data set such as NaaN, empty and data that is of an incorrect type.
- Formatting data frame column names and indexes to create organised and more understandable data.

### Exploratory Data analysis
- Categorising data into smaller data frames to perform a more granular analysis.
- Identifying unconventional trends within  the data set to provoke diversification of thought.
- Identifying storylines within the data set through the use of visualisation.
- What Intrigued me about exploratory data analysis is the use of colour, shape and form to convey meaning. Human cognitive perception allows us to extract meaning and make sense of the graphs displayed.
