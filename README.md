#### What interests me about data science.
What particualr interests me about data science is the exploratory analysis working within the Clinical Research indudstry has opended my eye to how crucial data is within drug development and undertanding the pharamkinetics how to the body metoblises thed drug. It's an industry that is data rich an abudance of data being able to perform anaylsis and udnerstand the effacy fo the drug. An example of this is trying to indentify areas of success. An example of this would be the average temperature of participants was considerably lower than participants how took the placebo, although that may be a very trival example it highlights the level of insight you can asitane from the exploratiry anaylsis.
My intermediate SQL skills have provided me a good introduction to data anaylsis espeically with relational databases which led me on to learning a more pwoerful tool within is
Python programmign liubraires suchas Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib being able to deal with much larger data sets.

### Data Cleaning and Data tidying

Below is  snippet of the processes involved when using Jupyter Notebook to clean and organise data. This is an important step as it creates data that is more understandable,
quicker and easier to run analysis.

- Identifying the inconsistencies within the data set such as NaaN, empty and data that is of an incorrect type.
- Formatting dataframe column names and indexes to create organised and more understandable data.

### Exploratory Data analysis
- Categorising data into smaller dataframes to perform a more granular anaylsis.
- Identifying unconventinal trends within  the data set to provoke diverisifcation of thought.
- Identifying storylines within the data set through the use of visualisation.
- Whatintrigued me about exploratory data anaylsis it the use of colour, shape and form to convey meaning. The humna congnitve percpetion allows us to extract emaning and make sense of the graphs displayed.
